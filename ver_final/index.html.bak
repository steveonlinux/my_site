        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <p>Welcome! This is the personal website of me... Steve. I'm a computer science major and this website is dedicated to my writings and thoughts. And any of my interests are fair game. I probably love Linux the most of anything material. It's at least in the top three. I'm constantly seeking to learn more about systems administration and the inner workings of the Linux kernel. And my interets in the kernel imply my interest in low-level programming languages like C and Rust. Maybe even lower... I almost typed a XOR joke. My interest in system administation also implies my interest in development and operations engineering. Servers and networks and acrnoyms oh my! I'm all the way into scripting and automating things to make my life easier. So I have more time to do other things I enjoy. Like watching films - classic noir, 80s boddy horror, and David Lynch hits the spot. Like buying techwear and gorpcore clothing - because I don't care about money. Like eating Indian, Thai, Medeterrainian or Soul food. Like reading some philosophy...there will be logic jokes somewhere on this site. Like going camping or hiking to escape and feel closer to what matters. And to share my growing and perhaps somethimes quaint knowledge. Which is in part why I'm establsihing this site. I'm not an expert in anything...yet. But, I hope I know enough to sahre something worth knowing to others - especailly fledgling students - through my writings.        </p>
