        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome! This is the personal website of me... Steve. I'm a computer science major and this website is dedicated to my writings and thoughts. And any of my interests are fair game. I probably love Linux the most of anything material. It's at least in the top three. I'm constantly seeking to learn more about systems administration and the inner workings of the Linux kernel. And my interest in the kernel implies my interest in low-level programming languages like C and Rust. My interest in system administration also implies my interest in development and operational engineering. Servers and networks, and acronyms oh my! I'm all the way into scripting and automating things to make my life easier. So I have more time to do other things I enjoy. Like watching films - classic noir, 80s body horror, and David Lynch hits the spot. Like buying techwear and gorpcore clothing - because I don't care about money. Like eating Indian, Thai, Mediterranean, or Soul food. Like reading some philosophy...there will be logic jokes somewhere on this site. Like going camping or hiking to escape and feel closer to what matters. And to share my growing and perhaps sometimes quaint knowledge. Which is in part why I'm establishing this site. I'm not an expert in anything...yet. But, I hope I know enough to share something worth knowing to others - especially fledgling students - through my writings.        </p>
